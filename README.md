## TODO

* Prevent completed games from being changed.
* Only count completed games for leaderboard stats.
* Game marks per round
* Redo player selection for x01 game mode
* better way to delete players from manage players screen, only admins, only if no stats?
* more better stats
* single and 3-player options
* varying number of games: single game, best of 3, best of 5, etc
* undo after game complete, or confirm end of game before proceeding
* individual game stats on game complete screen
* abandonned games don't count toward stats?
* final countdown nonsense must stop - make it rare, or vary the songs selected (eye of the tiger, whatever)
* immediate turn submit button?  would be useful for fixing entry mistakes, rather than waiting the requisite 5 seconds
* varying mark style?  have a library of mark options that can be pulled from
